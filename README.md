### Introduction and Purpose:
The purpose of this study, conducted by Max Pagan and Christian Castro, is to analyze data on beers and breweries in order to provide insight to Budweiser’s CEO and CFO that could help the company within the marketplace. The team used various statistical methods to investigate and collect evidence of relationships between variables that might prove helpful with further data and research. Looking at the data, the variables of Alcohol by Volume (ABV), International Bitterness Units (IBU), the names of the beers, the styles of the beers, and the names of the breweries were vital to understanding market trends and preferences. 

### Codebook: 

#### Transformations and merging:
First, any row missing both ABV and IBU was removed since there was not enough data to infer the values. Afterward, the mean IBU values were used to fill in missing values. 
The data was merged by combining data sets and relating them through the Brewery_ID and Brew_ID variables. 

#### Environment:
The R session used various libraries dplyr, tidyverse, naniar, class, caret, and ggplot2.
